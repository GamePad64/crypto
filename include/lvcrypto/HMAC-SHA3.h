 * This transformation is not really HMAC, as HMAC(Keccak) is not supported by CryptoPP.
 * As described on http://keccak.noekeon.org/ (than's Keccak creators' site):
 *
 *   Unlike SHA-1 and SHA-2, Keccak does not have the length-extension weakness,
 *   hence does not need the HMAC nested construction. Instead, MAC computation
 *   can be performed by simply prepending the message with the key.
 *
 * Okay, this solution is implemented here. Just prepending key to message.
